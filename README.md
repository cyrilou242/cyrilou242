### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- I'm a software engineer @[Startree.ai](https://www.startree.ai/).  
- I work on data intensive backends. I spend most of my time on [ThirdEye](https://github.com/startreedata/thirdeye/) these days.  
- My interest lies in streaming systems, data warehousing, timeseries analysis, data quality, and exploration/exploitation problems.  
- In terms of business, Iâ€™m mostly interested in cloud offerings and open-source business models.  
- Previously @[AB Tasty](https://www.abtasty.com/) and alumnus of Centrale Nantes - Computer Science.
